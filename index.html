        Listening to music is my favourite activity
    </h6>
    <p>
        Music is the art of arranging sounds in time to produce a composition through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm.
        I like music because it makes me <b>happy</b>, <b>lowers stress</b> improves health, helps me sleep better, reduces depression, elevates my mind while driving, strengthens learning and memory, reduces pain, increases verbal intelligence.

     particular computer architecture and sometimes to an operating system.However, some assembly 
    languages do not provide specific syntax for operating system calls, and most assembly languages 
    can be used universally with any operating system, as the language provides access to all the
     real capabilities of the processor, upon which all system call mechanisms ultimately rest. 
     In contrast to assembly languages, most high-level programming languages are generally portable 
     across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling, a much more complicated task
      than assembling.
