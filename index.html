        Listening to music is my favourite activity
    </h6>
    <p>
        Music is the art of arranging sounds in time to produce a composition through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm.
        I like music because it makes me <b>happy</b>, <b>lowers stress</b> improves health, helps me sleep better, reduces depression, elevates my mind while driving, strengthens learning and memory, reduces pain, increases verbal intelligence.
